This game is so badly designed in every way possible that I am absolutely confident that if this was my first video game that I played I would never play another video game. There are simply not enough words in the English lexicon for me to describe how awful of an experience this was, so instead, I'll just describe the game itself to you, so you won't have to go through hell for yourself. The game immediately starts (after the company logos) with a news broadcast hosted by Chicken Little and Henny Penny, they show the audience a controversial video tape "received" (not sure how) earlier that day. The tape shows a colorful cube, the cube then speaks; "From a mysterious dimension parallel to the Earth, greetings to all round fuzzy squishy things. I am Colonel Cubaqlees (i have no clue how you're supposed to spell this), leader of the Boolyon. We are speaking to you now to issue an ultimatum, free the cubes. Free the cubes! Or taste our vengeance. You have 24 hours." Then, it cuts back to Mr. Little and Ms. Penny Chicken Little: "We received this tape 23 hours and 50 minutes ago and what does it mean? *some chicken noise*" This is this game's crude attempt at humor, and I'm not even sure if it's supposed to be funny Chicken Little: "Our expert joins us. Dr. Carl Cockerel expert in crowd control and alien invasions." Henny Penny: "Carl Cockerel, the Boolyon, should we be afraid?" Carl Cockerel: "We should always be afraid, Henny, whether a threat is real or not. If any stranger enters your area, remember to cluck hysterically, flap your wings and run around in circles. We're chickens, that's what we do." Then Mr. Little and Ms. Penny share a brief exchange as they end the news broadcast. *10 Minutes later* Narrator: "You know the old saying "When the cats away, the mice will play"? But what do chickens do, when the farmer goes to town? Well *chuckles*, they have themselves a party." Music plays as the camera shows dozens of chickens in front of some kind of barn, one of the chickens has an especially long head...hair...thing. Then the camera pans to some stone well looking thing with lil' chicks surrounding it, as the narrator says; "Oh Mort was(?) having the time of his life!" It's incredibly difficult to understand what's being said as the music is so loud to the point it's drowning the narrator out. Then, the ground starts shaking and the narrator goes; "Wait a minute... That's not the script.", then a transparent cube comes out of the stone well and starts sucking all the chicks in the well...and also absorbs some of the chicks in its own cube body, somehow, then it goes back into the well. Surprisingly while every other chicken there seems to be unbothered by this event, one chicken stands up and jumps into the well after the chicks... Mort the Chicken. Immediately after this cutscene ends, you are jumpscared by Mort's cold, dead eyes, staring directly into your soul. I was playing this at 3 AM, I could not describe to you the pure genuine fear this still image of Mort had put into my soul. After you press START, you are greeted with the grating noise of many chicks, the chicks form the menu options, which is pretty cool actually (if it weren't for them making that awful noise)</td></tr><tr><td>168</td><td>The Binding of Isaac: Repentance</td><td>PC</td><td>-18282709821</td><td>2022</td><td>Yep</td><td>edmund mcmillen, you little fucker. you made a shit of piece with your trash isaac, it's fucking bad tyhis trash game. i will become back my money.</td></tr></table></body></html><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><img class="post__image" src="https://evetimekeeper.github.io/media/files/FUCK-WADDLE-DOO.gif" alt="" width="326" height="163"></p><p><img class="post__image" src="https://evetimekeeper.github.io/media/files/DIEDIEYOUVILECREATURE.gif" alt="" width="292" height="347"></p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="allllll the way to the top" title="allllll the way to the top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://evetimekeeper.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://evetimekeeper.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
